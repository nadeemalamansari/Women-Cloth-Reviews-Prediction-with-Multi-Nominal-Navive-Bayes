Project Description
Customer reviews provide valuable insights into products, and analyzing these reviews helps in understanding customer sentiment. This project aims to classify reviews of women's clothing into categories of positive or negative sentiment using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. The project involves text data preprocessing, feature extraction through techniques like TF-IDF, and the application of machine learning to achieve accurate predictions.

Data
The dataset used includes:

Review Text: The actual text of the review.
Review Rating: The rating given by the customer (used as a proxy for sentiment).
Other Features: Additional features such as product category, clothing ID, etc., which may be used in exploratory data analysis.
The data is stored in a CSV file and can be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for processing.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/nadeemalamsnari/women-cloth-reviews.git
cd women-cloth-reviews
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
The project includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for each stage of the workflow. You can preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions by running the following scripts:

Preprocessing the Data
bash
Copy code
python preprocess.py --input data/women_cloth_reviews.csv --output data/processed_reviews.csv
Training the Model
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --input data/processed_reviews.csv --output model/naive_bayes_model.pkl
Making Predictions
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --model model/naive_bayes_model.pkl --input data/new_reviews.csv --output predictions.csv
Model
The model pipeline includes:

Text Preprocessing: This involves cleaning the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and performing tokenization.
Feature Extraction: Using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to convert the text into numerical features.
Model Training: Applying Multinomial Naive Bayes, which is suitable for text classification due to its effectiveness with word frequency features.
Model Tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and robustness.
Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified reviews.
Precision: The proportion of true positive reviews among all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive reviews among all actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's ability to correctly classify reviews.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X%, with a precision of Y%, recall of Z%, and an F1-score of W%. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in predicting sentiment from women's clothing reviews.
